This script allows for someone to manage a movie night selection process.

First the user sets up their genres and then adds their movies.

Then when you ask for a selected set of movies, the script randomly choses a genre and then randomly chooses a subset of that genre for the movie night goes to vote on.

The movies are stored as JSON in the genre files so they can be manipulated directly for mass adding.
